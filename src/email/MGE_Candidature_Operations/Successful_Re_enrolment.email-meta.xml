    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


I am pleased to advise  you that you have been successfully re-enrolled in your degree.


There has been a systemic issue with the Web Enrolment System which is presently being investigated.  Nevertheless, I have checked your enrolment in CALLISTA and can confirm that you have successfully re-enrolled for 2017.


Should you have any concerns or require further assistance, you are welcome to contact me.


Kind regards,

{!User.FirstName}
