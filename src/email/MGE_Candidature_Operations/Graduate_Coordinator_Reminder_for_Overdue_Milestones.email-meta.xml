    <textOnly>I am writing to you concerning the overdue milestone for this student.

Our records indicate that this student’s confirmation/mid candidature review/pre-submission seminar was due on XXX.


Under the Graduate Research Progress Management Policy and Procedure research students must satisfactorily achieve the requirements of the milestone in order to remain enrolled. A failure to meet the requirements of a milestone means that the student is deemed to be making unsatisfactory progress.  All milestones are defined as hurdle requirements.


Could you please advise me of what arrangements have been made for this milestone to be finalised.


Can you please response by PROVIDE 5 WORKING DAYS.


Please contact MGE on 03 9905 3050 or mge-rcandidature@monash.edu for enquiries and more information.


If we can be of any further assistance, please don&apos;t hesitate to contact the MGE Candidature team on 9905 3050.


Kind regards,

XNAMEX
