    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},



I am writing to you regarding students who have been encumbered in your Faculty. Please find attached a report as at XXXX which identifies students in your Faculty who have been sent a number of emails by MGE regarding an encumbrance on their enrolment.  These students were informed that they needed to resolve the encumbrance in order for them to re-enrol for 20XXX.  Unfortunately the students on the list have not yet resolved their encumbrance and therefore are unable to re-enrol for the following year.

Could you please follow-up with these students as a final attempt to have them resolve the encumbrance and therefore re-enrol before close of University business Wednesday 21 December 20XXX

If there are any exceptional circumstance as to why a particular student cannot re-enrol please email MGE urgently with details.

Please note that should students not be re-enrolled by 5:00pm on Wednesday 21 December 20XXX their enrolment will be discontinued for failure to re-enrol and scholarships (where applicable) will be suspended.

Should you have any concerns or require further assistance, you are welcome to contact me.



Kind regards,

Kerry Theodora
