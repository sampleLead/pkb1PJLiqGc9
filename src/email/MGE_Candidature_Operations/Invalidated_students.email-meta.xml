    <textOnly>Dear GRMF,

The Student Finance Unit has provided the attached spreadsheet with details of students that have been invalidated. Their current load/s will be removed from Callista if payment is not received by 24 February 20XXX


The students have been sent five (5) different sets of correspondence relating to their unpaid fees (such as emails, a Fee statement, Final notice, letter of encumbrance). It would appear they have made no attempts to pay and have not contacted Student Finance either.


All students on the list have been individually informed in writing that they have been invalidated and that they must pay the reinstatement fine of $204.00 plus any outstanding fees in order to be reinstated for this semester. They have also been informed that they will be required to re-enrol for future semesters.


Could you please follow up with these students as well to ensure their invalidation is lifted from Callista.


Many thanks,

Kind regards,
