    <textOnly>Dear Individual student’s names,


You are now in the final stages of your research studies.  I am writing to remind you that your official thesis submission date is XXXXX.


If you submit your thesis by Tuesday 1 December 20XXX  then your thesis will be sent out to examiners prior to the University holiday closure.  However, if you submit your thesis after this date then your thesis will be sent out for examination when the University re-opens in early January 2017. The MGE will be accepting theses until Monday 21 December 2016.


If you are unable to submit your thesis by your submission date, then you will need to apply for an extension by using the Extension to Thesis Submission Form, at least 10 working days prior to the submission date.  It is very important that this is received by MGE in a timely manner as there is no grace period.


Should your extension period take you into 2017, then you will need to ensure that you re-enrol for that period of time.  Please refer to click Re-enrolment for Research Students.


If you are an international student, tuition fees will apply for the period of extension.  I would also strongly encouraged you to contact Monash Connect for advice regarding your student visa, either by phone on +61 3 9902 6011 or www.monash.edu/connect.


We are here to support and assist you, therefore should you have any queries or concerns, please contact me on xxxx xxxx or email xxxxxxxxxxxx.


Kind regards,
