    <subject>Reject Extension Requests according to Policy - {!Contact.Name} {!Contact.Person_ID__c}</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


I am writing to you concerning your application for extension to your thesis submission date.

On the basis of information provided in your application for extension to thesis submission date, we are unable to approve your request at this time.

Requests for an extension to thesis submission date will be considered only in exceptional circumstances where your research has been delayed by circumstances beyond your control (e.g. equipment breakdown, delays in ethical approval of research, etc.). There should also be clear evidence that you are committed and actively progressing towards completion.

Requests for an extension due to illness will not be considered, as students experiencing a period of sickness should apply for leave of absence at the time of their illness and not retrospectively. Employment commitments are also not acceptable grounds for an extension

Should you have grounds that you think comply with the policy, please provide a revised application for consideration.


Kind regards,

{!User.FirstName}
