    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},



Thank you for your email.


Due to a systems error, a number of students were sent email advice stating they have not yet re-enrolled. We are currently investigating this matter to find out what the issues are and hope to resolve it as soon as possible


I wish to confirm with you that you are re-enrolled for 2017, and apologies for any inconvenience caused.


Should you have any concerns or require further assistance, you are welcome to contact me.


Kind regards,

{!User.FirstName}
