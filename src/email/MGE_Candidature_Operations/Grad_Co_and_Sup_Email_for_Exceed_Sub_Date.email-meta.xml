Dear Graduate Co-ordinators OR Supervisors,


I am writing to inform you that your student, NAME AND ID OF STUDENT/S has exceeded their thesis submission date - (KEEP FOR SUPERVISORS ONLY. ATTACH REPORT FOR GRAD-COS)


MGE run Reports which identifying students whose enrolment has expired and these are uploaded to the MGE intranet by the first Friday of each month.


Under Section 8 : Graduate Research Progress Management Procedures, where a student fails to submit their thesis (or equivalent) by their thesis submission date,  will be discontinued in good standing if:

they have exhausted their extension allocation, or,
they have not responded to the Universityâ€™s attempts to   contact them regarding their thesis  submission.

To resume their course of study, former students must apply for re-admission as per the process outlined in the Graduate Research Re-admission Procedures.


Monash Graduate Education (MGE) sends official notifications to each student regarding their upcoming thesis submission date: the first at three months prior, and a follow up notification, at one month prior.


Reports identifying students approaching their thesis submission dates are uploaded to the MGE intranet by the first Friday of each month. These reports and notifications are a key element of our strategy of managing students to submission.


To date, no action has been taken by the student to submit their thesis or apply for an extension to their thesis submission date.


MGE will commence the process of administratively discontinuing these students in good standing by the close of business on ADD DATE HERE (= 7 WORKING DAYS).


Should there be any extenuating circumstances that need to be considered prior to this date, Graduate Co-ordinators should contact mge-candidature@monash.edu by close of business on (ADD DATE HERE (= ONE DAY BEFORE DATE ABOVE).


Kind regards,




Professor Sharon Ricardo

Academic Director, Graduate Research</textOnly>
