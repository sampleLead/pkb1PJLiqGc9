    <textOnly>Dear Graduate Research Student



Our records indicate that your progress review milestone has not been achieved.  The following action is required:



1. If your milestone review has been conducted and your paperwork finalised, please send email confirmation to mge-candidature@monash.edu providing details of the date the milestone review panel convened.



2. Where you have undertaken your milestone review and minor amendments are required, these amendments should be completed within one week (equivalent full-time) of the milestone presentation date to the satisfaction of the panel.  Please send email advice to mge-candidature@monash.edu providing details of the due date for submission of these amendments.



3. If your review has not been held, you need to liaise with your Graduate Coordinator, supervisor and/or research administrator to immediately commence review arrangements.



4. From 1 January 2015 all milestones are formal hurdle requirements and must be achieved by the due date of the milestone.



To prepare for your milestone, you should take the following action:



1. Check your milestone due dates by logging in to WES (Web Enrolment System).  Note these dates may change if you have a leave or attendance variation application pending.



2. Complete the milestone report form and forward it to your supervisor/graduate coordinator.



3. Check your faculty specific milestone requirements to see if they have any additional requirements for your review:



• Handbook for Doctoral Degrees : Appendix J
• Handbook for Research Master&apos;s Degrees: Appendix D



Please note:



• Milestone extension requests can only be considered where research has been delayed by circumstances beyond your control.  No extensions are permitted for pre-Mid Candidature reviews or pre-Submission Seminars.  Section 4 of the Graduate Research Progress Management Procedures provides full details.



• Masters by research students transferring to a PhD should refer to Section 7 of the Graduate Research Progress Management Procedures for transfer timeframe details.



• Gippsland students: the Panel Chair must prepare a brief report outlining your progress and identifying any issues that might interfere with your expected submission date.  This report must be attached to your review form.



Since 1 January 2015:



• All milestones are considered formal hurdle requirements. This change is applicable to all students commencing from this date and current students whose review is held on or after 1 January 2015.



• Supervisors will continue to play an integral role in the process but will no longer have formal decision making authority on the panel established to review student progress. For more information please refer to the Guidelines for Milestone Review Panels and Academic Progress Review Panels and section 5 of the Graduate Research Progress Management Procedures.


You must complete all your program requirements prior to the pre-Submission Seminar/final review.  The thesis examination cannot commence until you have satisfactorily completed all your milestone reviews.
Contact MGE on 03 9905 3050 or mge-candidature@monash.edu for enquiries and more information.



Kind regards,
