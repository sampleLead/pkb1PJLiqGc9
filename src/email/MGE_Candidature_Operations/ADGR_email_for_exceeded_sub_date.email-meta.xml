SUBJECT: Discontinue in Good Standing


Dear XYZ,


I am writing to advise that the following student/s enrolment has expired:


· SURNAME, GN (ID ########)

· SURNAME, GN (ID ########)




MGE have made at least two attempts to notify this/these student/s of their upcoming thesis submission date. The Graduate Coordinator and supervisor were also notified of the status of this/these student/s on DATE.


To date, no action has been taken by the student to submit their thesis or apply for an extension to their thesis submission date.


This/These student/s will now be discontinued in good standing.


Kind regards,


Professor Sharon Ricardo
