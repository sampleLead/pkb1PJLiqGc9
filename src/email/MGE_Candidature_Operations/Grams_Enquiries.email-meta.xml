    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},



I am pleased to confirm that you are now registered in the GRAMS system.


GRAMS works with the student Monash IT account/ Monash username/password only, however if you use your staff account, it stores it in the cache and so remains confused.


To ensure continued access, you should close your browser and start again using your Monash student IT account/ Monash username/password, or open a different browser and use only your student Monash IT account/ Monash username/password there.


If you don&apos;t have Google Chrome on your university computer, download it via the My Software menu found on the Windows Startup button, bottom left of the screen. (you&apos;ll also find lots of other goodies)


Let us know if you are still having problems.


Kind regards,

{!User.FirstName}
