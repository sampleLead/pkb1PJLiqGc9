I am pleased to advise you that the Academic Director has approved your application for re-admission. This email correspondence details important information to assist in your re-admission to your degree at Monash University.

In order to accept your offer and enrol, please submit your acceptance form together with all the enrolment documents to us at MGE front counter or via email mge-candidature@monash.edu


If you have new arrangements affecting IP and or ethics, you must submit new completed forms at the time of enrolment.  To assist you we have attached copies of intellectual property and ethics clearance forms with this offer. If there are no changes then you do not have to complete these forms.


It is important that you take some time to carefully read the conditions on your offer and ensure that you understand and meet these requirements either at acceptance or at enrolment, as your enrolment will not be completed, until all conditions are met.
