The PhD application process involves six steps, outlined on the How to apply web page.



First, you need to decide on a research area. An Education research degree can be completed in any field of research where sufficient expertise and resources are available.

While deciding on a topic, you can browse our seven departments to see which is most related to your area of interest.



Next, you will need to find a supervisor who agrees to direct you in your research degree. You can browse for potential supervisors by topic or by name. When you email potential supervisors, please include a brief outline of your academic interests or project and a resume. You can refer to the Writing a research proposal page for guidance.



Once you have identified a supervisor, you will lodge an Expression of Interest (EOI) form. Please allow four weeks after sending in your EOI for an outcome.
