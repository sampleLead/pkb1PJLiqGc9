    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.First_Name_case_corrected__c},



Thank you for your interest in the Master of Engineering Science by research with the Faculty of Engineering, Monash University. Our Faculty of Engineering is one of the largest in Australia, renowned worldwide for the quality of our teaching, research and calibre of our graduates.



It’s fantastic to hear that you are considering undertaking your research with us.



&lt;&lt;Answer query&gt;&gt;



I have also included general information about this course below, including entry requirements, fees, and useful links for further information.



Course information

The Faculty of Engineering focuses on three key areas of research:


Biomedical technology
Critical infrastructure systems
Sustainable design, manufacturing and resourcing


Supporting these research focus areas is outstanding research infrastructure, available to all research staff.



This master’s program is completed over two years full-time or four years part-time. In addition to a substantial research thesis of up to 50,000 words, students are also required to complete a series of professional development activities or coursework units.



Entry requirements

Admission criteria for research courses requires one of the following minimum qualifications in a relevant discipline:


a four-year bachelor&apos;s degree which normally includes a research component in the fourth year, leading to honours 1 or 2A; or
a coursework master&apos;s degree with a significant research component including at least 25% of one full-time equivalent year of work, including a thesis (Please note that it is normally expected that a grade of honours 2A has been obtained for the research thesis or project); or
a qualification which the Graduate Research Committee has deemed equivalent.


Applicants must also meet the university English language requirements.



Course fees

Domestic: The Australian government covers the tuition fees for all domestic master’s by research students. You will be required to pay an annual Student Services and Amenities Fee (SSAF).



International: Fees are subject to change annually. The international student fee for 2016 is $38,900 AUD per full-time year.



Scholarships opportunities are available, including Engineering-specific research scholarships.



How to apply

The research master’s application process involves six steps, outlined on our useful How to apply web page.



First, you need to decide on a research area. A Faculty of Engineering research degree can be completed in any field of research where sufficient expertise and resources are available. I recommend reviewing our faculty’s research strength areas while considering a topic.



Next, you will need to find a supervisor who agrees to direct you in your research degree. For potential supervisors please see the following Departmental webpages, depending on your chosen topic:


Department of Chemical Engineering
Department of Civil Engineering
Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering
Department of Materials Science Engineering
Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering


When you email potential supervisors, please include a brief outline of your academic interests or project and a resume.



Once you have identified a supervisor, you will lodge an Expression of Interest (EOI) form by emailing the provided form either to the department/school administration officer that best matches your area of research or directly to your nominated supervisor.



Applications can be accepted at any time, yet it is strongly advised that you lodge the EOI no later than 30th April and 30th September for the scholarship rounds.



If approved, you will be sent an invitation to formally apply. Please allow four weeks after sending in your EOI for an outcome.
