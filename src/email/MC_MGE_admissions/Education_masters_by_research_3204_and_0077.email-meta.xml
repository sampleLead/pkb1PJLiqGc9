    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.First_Name_case_corrected__c},



Thank you for your interest in the Monash Doctoral Program with the Faculty of Law, Monash University.



Itâ€™s fantastic to hear you that are considering undertaking your research with us.


&lt;&lt;Answer query&gt;&gt;


I have also included general information about this course below, including entry requirements, fees, and useful links for further information.



Course information

Monash Law School has earned an international reputation for the work of our dedicated research centres and Faculty research projects.



In addition to a substantial research thesis of up to 80,000 words, students are also required to complete a series of professional development activities or coursework units.



Entry requirements

Admission criteria for the Doctor of Philosophy requires one of the following minimum qualifications in a relevant discipline:


a four-year bachelor&apos;s degree which normally includes a research component in the fourth year, leading to honours 1 or 2A; or
a coursework master&apos;s degree with a significant research component including at least 25% of one full-time equivalent year of work, including a thesis (Please note that it is normally expected that a grade of honours 2A has been obtained for the research thesis or project); or
a qualification which the Graduate Research Committee has deemed equivalent.

Applicants must also meet the university English language requirements.



How to apply

The PhD application process involves four steps, outlined on our useful How to apply web page.


First, you need to decide on a research area. A Faculty of Law research degree can be completed in any field of research where sufficient expertise and resources are available.


Once you have identified a research topic, you will need to send an Expression of Interest (EOI) to the Law Research team at law-graduate-research@monash.edu. Your EOI should include:


Research proposal (Please see the structure required by the Faculty in the provided link)
Curriculum vitae (CV) and
Copies of academic transcripts


The Faculty will then assist you in identifying suitable supervisors who will direct you in your research. You are also welcome to nominate one or more staff members as part of your research proposal. I encourage you to browse our faculty list of staff expertise for ideas for potential supervisors.


Applications for this course can be accepted at any time, however it is strongly advised that you lodge the EOI no later than 30th April and 30th September for the scholarship rounds.


If approved, you will be sent an invitation to formally apply. Please allow four weeks after sending in your EOI for an outcome.


Course fees

Domestic: The Australian government covers the tuition fees for all domestic PhD students. You will be required to pay an annual Student Services and Amenities Fee (SSAF).


International: Please note that fees are subject to change annually. The international student fee for 2016 is $33,600 per full-time year.


Scholarships opportunities are available, including Law-specific research scholarships.
