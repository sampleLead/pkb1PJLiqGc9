    <textOnly>Dear STUDENT OR STAFF MEMBER NAME,



Following on from our conversation earlier Graduate Education has received STUDENT NAME AND ID application for Travel grant.

As the student has indicated that he will be traveling from DATES OF TRAVEL this is a retrospective application and will need to be presented to the Academic Director for approval.

Can you please provide us with a case on the reasons on delays of submission of application and evidence of students activities  as stated in his travel plan.

Once Graduate Education has received this information STUDENT NAME application will be presented to the Academic Director.

Should you have any further queries, please don&apos;t hesitate to contact me directly.
