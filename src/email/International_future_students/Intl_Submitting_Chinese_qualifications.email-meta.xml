    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.First_Name_case_corrected__c},



Thank you for your interest in studying at Monash University, consistently ranked in the top one per cent of world universities (Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2015-2016).



Documents pertaining to Chinese qualifications must be correctly translated using one of the following two methods:




Documents may be notarised by the ‘Public Notary Office of People&apos;s Republic of China’. Notary certification must include a certificate stating that translations of all documents in English are authentic and in conformity with the original in Chinese.


If you are providing copies of the notarised documents then you will also need to have the copies certified.


Your translated degree certificate and transcripts can be sent to our office in a sealed envelope, directly from your University. They may post the documents to the following location:




Central Admissions

Monash Connect, Clayton Campus

21 Chancellors Walk, Campus Centre

Monash University,

I hope you have found this information valuable. If there is any other way in which I can be of assistance, please contact me by replying to this email or calling me at 1800 MONASH (666 274).
