    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.First_Name_case_corrected__c},



Thank you for your interest in studying at Monash University, consistently ranked in the top one per cent of world universities (Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2015-2016).



If you have studied at an institution where English was the language of instruction and assessment for the entire institute, you may have met the English language requirement for entry into your chosen course.



For detailed information on accepted English language proficiency, please visit www.monash.edu/admissions/english-language-requirements.




If you believe that you have met the English requirement because you undertook study where English was the language of instruction, you will need to provide documentary evidence. This should be in the form of a letter from the institution at which the study was undertaken.



Upon receipt of this letter we will review whether you have satisfied the English language requirement and we will advise you of the outcome accordingly. Any decision made will be at the discretion of Monash University.




I hope you have found this information valuable. If there is any other way in which I can be of assistance, please contact me by replying to this email or calling me at 1800 MONASH (666 274).
