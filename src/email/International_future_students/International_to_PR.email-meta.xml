    <subject>Thankyou for your enquiry to Monash University, ref #{!Case.CaseNumber}</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.First_Name_case_corrected__c},



Thank you for your interest in studying at Monash University, consistently ranked in the top one per cent of world universities (Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2015-2016).



If you are in the process of applying for your Permanent Residency (PR), however, your PR has not yet been granted, you are still considered to be an international student. As such you will not be able to apply as a domestic student until your change of residency status has been granted.

For international student applicants who are granted permanent residency to stay in Australia before enrolling into a Monash course, evidence of change of residency must be provided. Evidence includes documentation such as the date of the visa grant as indicated on the visa label affixed to the passport or on the visa grant letter. At this point we will withdraw the offer as an international student and forward the application to the relevant Monash University faculty for processing as a domestic student applicant.
It is important to note for students who change residency to become permanent residents or citizens of Australia, there is no guarantee that a Commonwealth Supported Place (CSP) or full fee paying place will be available or granted.

For international student applicants who are granted PR after enrolment into a course, you must contact Monash Connect on your campus who will assist you in completing the appropriate steps to change your status to that of a domestic student. Please note that some courses have a quota and it may not be possible to transfer your course as a domestic student. In which case, it may not be possible for you to complete your course.

If you are interested in applying to Monash University after you have obtained PR, please contact Monash Connect as the entry requirements and application methods vary for domestic student applicants.  You can either reply here, or at the contact details below.
