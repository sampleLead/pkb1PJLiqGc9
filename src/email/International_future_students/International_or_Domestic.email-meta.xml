    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.First_Name_case_corrected__c},



Thank you for your interest in studying at Monash University, consistently ranked in the top one per cent of world universities (Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2015-2016).



Are you able to reply back to this email to confirm under which status you will be studying at Monash University - as an international or domestic student?



I have included information below for your convenience.


You are a domestic student if you are an Australian citizen (including dual citizens), or a New Zealand citizen (including dual citizens), or a permanent resident of Australia.
You are an international fee-paying student if you hold a permit for temporary entry to Australia.



As the entry requirements and application methods vary, it would be best for us to first determine which category you fall under so that we can send you the most relevant information.



Please contact me by replying to this email or calling me at 1800 MONASH (666 274).




Kind regards
