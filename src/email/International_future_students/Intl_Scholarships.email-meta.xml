    <subject>Thankyou for your enquiry to Monash University, ref #{!Case.CaseNumber}</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.First_Name_case_corrected__c},



Thank you for your interest in studying at Monash University, consistently ranked in the top one per cent of world universities (Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2015-2016).



If you&apos;re an international applicant and apply direct with Monash University or through an Agent for entry into a course for one of the following faculties, you&apos;ll automatically be considered for either the:

Business and Economics International Pathway Scholarship
Business and Economics International China Scholarship
Faculty of Information Technology International Merit Scholarship
Pharmacy International Undergraduate Merit Scholarship
Science International Merit Scholarship

Because assessment is conducted automatically, no special application is needed. If you have been awarded a scholarship you will be notified in due course. The scholarships are awarded based on academic merits so exceptional grades are required as scholarship places are extremely limited and very competitive.



If you are an international student studying Australian Year 12 or IB only, you will be automatically assessed for scholarships when you submit a course application through VTAC.


Information on international scholarships can be found on the following webpage: http://www.monash.edu.au/study/scholarships/international/


For any enquiries please contact the Coursework Scholarships Unit on: http://www.monash.edu.au/study/scholarships/contact-us.html


For application closing dates, please refer to the following webpage: http://www.monash.edu.au/study/scholarships/applications/


All applicants will be notified in writing.




Monash University also offers two additional scholarships to celebrate outstanding achievement:

· Monash International Leadership Scholarship

· Monash International Merit Scholarship


As there are limited scholarships, the process is highly competitive and scholarships will be awarded based on outstanding academic achievement, as well as a personal statement with the potential to become a Monash Ambassador.


In order to be considered for these scholarships you are required to apply by submitting a separate application form.
