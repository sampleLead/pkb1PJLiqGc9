    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.First_Name_case_corrected__c},



We are excited at Monash to be trialing a new online ID card photo submission process.  This is quick and easy and the hope is that this solution will make getting an ID card simpler. As this is a new process, you are an ideal candidate to trial this, and then we can post your ID card out to you.



All you will need is:


an existing online photo (or you can take a selfie)
copy of photo identification, such as drivers licence or passport


You will need to go to http://monash.edu/photo-id



If you have been able to upload your photo, can you please reply to me so that I can process your card.  Then I will send out your approved ID card.



If there is any other way in which I can be of assistance, please contact me by replying to this email or calling me at 1800 MONASH (666 274).



Kind regards
