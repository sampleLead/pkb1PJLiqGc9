    <subject>Nomination of Doctoral Examiners: 2 Victorian Examiners</subject>
    <textOnly>As we are In progress of ......&apos;s submission it has been noticed that both the nominated examiners are from Victoria. The committee expects at least one doctoral examiner to be from outside Victoria. Can you please provide a statement justifying these two nominees for consideration by our Steering Committee. Alternatively, you can nominate a replacement examiner for one of the two.

Please email me your justification statement or send us a new Nomination form if you are nominating a replacement examiner.
