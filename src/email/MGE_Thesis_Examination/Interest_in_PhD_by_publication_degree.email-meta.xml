    <textOnly>Dear {!Case.Contact},


Thank you for your email and interest in our PhD degree.


All doctoral and research master’s students are permitted to submit a thesis including published works. The thesis including published works is not a different degree; rather, it is a thesis format that includes papers that have been prepared, or accepted, for publication. Papers must have been researched and written during the course of enrolment.


More information on thesis including published works is available here.


If you have any questions regarding your PhD application, please contact Admissions at mge-apply@monash.edu.


Best regards
