    <textOnly>Dear {!Case.Contact},

Thank you for your email.

Your examination is progressing well. Regretfully we are unable to update you on the status of your examination results, or receipt of any specific examiner reports to date due to examination rules. Please be reassured that Graduate

Education maintains contact with your examiners and reminders are issued on a regular basis. Once all reports have been proceed you will be notified as soon as possible.

In extreme cases when the examination report(s) are significantly overdue, Graduate Education will contact your main
supervisor to discuss.

If you have registered to Graduate and are concerned you may not make the deadline, you can defer to the next

Graduation ceremony. For detailed information, please contact Graduations office.

Best wishes

Thank you
