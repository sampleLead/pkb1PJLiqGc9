Thank you for lodging an application for the Postgraduate Publication Award.

The Selection Committee was impressed by the standard of applications received this round and had difficulty in making its selection. Unfortunately I regret to advise that you were unsuccessful.

May I take this opportunity to congratulate you on your thesis submission and wish you every success in your future endeavours.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me via email: mge-thesisexams@monash.edu
