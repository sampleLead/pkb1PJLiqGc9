Dear {!Case.Contact},


Congratulations on your thesis submission. It has come to our attention that a copyright notice has not been included in either of your soft thermal bound or PDF thesis copies. As this is a requirement, could you kindly include a copyright notice in the preliminary pages of your PDF thesis and resend via reply email. Please refer to the template for details.


Please note we cannot continue with the examination until this requirement has been met.


For more information on thesis preliminary pages, please see visit the website:


Thank you.
