    <textOnly>Dear Colleague,


We hope that you are settling in well to your new position and are finding your way through all the information about Monash.


We are writing to you to invite you to join the Early Career Researcher (ECR) Network here at Monash. Membership is free for all Monash University ECRs.


What is an ECR?

Here at Monash, we define an ECR as someone who:

was awarded their PhD  within five years of the last five years (or equivalent research qualification/ experience), or

holds up to five cumulative years of research experience, allowing for career interruptions arising from professional or personal issues.

Some faculties extend this definition to ten years post-award when inviting researchers to events in their discipline; please check with your local area about whether this applies.


What membership provides

Monash University is committed to supporting ECRs like yourself, early in your research career as it is the time when you can gain substantial benefit from professional development and other support opportunities.


At the ECR Network we offer:

Career development specifically tailored to the needs of ECRs
Opportunities to develop the skills necessary to undertake world-class research
Knowledge and insight into the core practices of researchers
Networking opportunities with peers within your discipline and across the university, and with senior researchers and leaders
Information about scholarships, grants, internships and award schemes relevant to ECRs.

Join the Network now
