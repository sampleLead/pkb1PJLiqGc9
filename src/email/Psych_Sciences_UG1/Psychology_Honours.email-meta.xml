Many thanks for your email and for your interest in our Psychology Honours Program .

Overview
The Monash Honours in Psychology is accredited by the Australian Psychological Accreditation Council (APAC) and delivers high quality research training that enables students to register as a provisional psychologist and pursue further research and training in psychology.
Students study the theoretical and practical application of psychology through a combination of coursework units and a research thesis within the School’s research themes.

The course is delivered on-campus at Clayton over a duration of one (1) year full-time or two (2) years part-time. Part-time students complete the coursework units in first year and their research thesis in second year.

Entry requirements
You must have completed a bachelor’s degree or graduate diploma that includes the APAC accredited major of ten units in psychology no more than five (5) years prior to commencement of the course.

Admission to the program is competitive and determined on the basis of academic merit. A minimum distinction (70%) in the four (4) core Level 3 units (PSY3041, PSY3051, PSY3032 and PSY3062) is required to be competitive for selection. In practice, however, the cut-off in generally around 78-79%.
