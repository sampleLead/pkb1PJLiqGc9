    <textOnly>Dear Colleagues,

We have received a deferral request. Please see below for more information.

We are seeking your advice as to whether or not this is acceptable to the department/faculty/supervisor(s) and that resources and facilities will still be available at that time.

If your answer is affirmative, we will note the new commencement date in our system and advise the student via an amended offer letter.

It would be greatly appreciated if you could please reply to all when responding with your approval.

Thank you for your assistance and we look forward to hearing from you.

Kind Regards,

{!Case.OwnerFirstName}
